When perl is updated all of the added modules are lost and must be
reinstalled - a huge disincentive to upgrading. Here are (some) of the
modules that will need to be reinstalled following an upgrade:

cpanm XML::XPath
cpanm XML::Twig
cpanm Date::Calc
cpanm Win32::DriveInfo
cpanm Win32::GUI
cpanm Mac::iTunes::Library
cpanm Win32::FileOp --force   [after 5 years it still requires --force!!]
